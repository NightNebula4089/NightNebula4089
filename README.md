- 👋 Hi, I’m @NightNebula4089
- 👀 I’m interested in mathematics, physics and computer science and coding. I would love to learn coding but regardless of giving my best effots I have not yet gotten anything out of watching online videos/trying to code for myself and learn it myself. I am a NOOB.
- 🌱 I’m currently in igcse and soon to be in the AS levels. I have a above average aptitude for mathematics and physics, currently I am studying multivariable calculus in mathematics and magnetism and electricity in physics.
- 💞️ I’m looking to learn coding here.
